* Wordle Analytics

It would be nice if the bot could more accurately judge performance of
a player.

- When a player makes a *mistake* - chastise them
- When they make near optimal word choices - congratulate them
- Have some kind of post match analysis
- Inform them when they had a lucky guess

How to achieve this?

- First, we need a function that, given a guess word and the letter
  categories, can work out all matching words from the dictionary.
- Given this, given a series of guesses and word categories, we can
  easily find the set of matching words that the answer must be among.
- The "optimal" guess, is the word which when guesses, reduces the
  possible candidate list by the maximum amount.
- How much calculation are we talking about?
    - There are 2457 words in the :easy set (these are the possible
      answers)
    - There are 5874 words in the :all set (these are the possible
      valid guesses)
    - So, worst case easy in game before 1st guess we could see around
      (* 5874 2457) comparisons to be made - 1.4 million - but likely
      in the 100s of K for a typical game
    - On my dinky dual core 2014 era server I would guess this will
      take a few seconds? It may be doable.. especially if we employ
      optimisations below:
- There are some (many?) optimisations to be done:
    - The largest candidate list is at the start. We could memoise the
      candidate list for opening words?
    - We could "merge" the rules - rather than have 3 uess words with
      3 sets of letter categories, can they be merged into one set of
      known facts?
    - Test fastest "exclusions" first. eg "word must contain a D at
      1st position" can be quickly tested for?
